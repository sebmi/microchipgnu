### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an artist working with sound, shapes & colors, grow up in France (in the Champagne's territory if that's sounds interesting to you) now based in Guadeloupe. 

I've been focused on two principal point : 
ðŸŽ¼ ðŸ”Š  on music enginering, sound (compositing, recording, design), art-therapy, music & light's vibrations, immersive kindness for ourself, creative tools.
ðŸŽ¨  on painting, with wide tool palette. From physical (oil, acrylic, aqua,...) to digital (pixel art, digital painting, digital drawing,...)

- ðŸŒ± ðŸŽ¨ ï¿½ Iâ€™m currently working at Les Jardins de Valentin (Carribean Ethical brand) & Art by MIOT (Artist workshop)
